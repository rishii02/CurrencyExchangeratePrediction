# CurrencyExchangeratePrediction
This is the Final Project for Machine Learning course at Mahindra University. Currency exchange rate prediction is a regression problem in machine learning. There are changes in return rates each day that influence the pay of an individual, a business, or can even influence the economy of a country. As a result, forecasting exchange rates can help a person understand a country from a variety of perspectives. Primarily, Linear Regression, Desicion Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression algorithms were used to predict future currency exchange rates. After carefully analyzing the r2_scores, MAE and other performance metrics Linear Regression gave better predictions than other regresssion algorithms.
